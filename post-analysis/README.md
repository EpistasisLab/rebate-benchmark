# Post-analysis

This directory contains the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used to analyze and visualize the results of the ReBATE benchmark.

These scripts assume that the outputs of the scripts in the `model-code` directory have been saved to flat text files in a common directory.

The accompanying `SimulatedDataArchiveSummary.xlsx` spreadsheet is used to determine the correct ranking for each benchmark dataset.
