# Feature selection algorithm code

This directory contains all of the Python scripts used to run the various Relief and other feature selection algorithms on the benchmark datasets.

These Python scripts are written to receive the path to a benchmark dataset as input, fit the feature selection algorithm to the dataset, and print the feature rankings and scores for every feature in the dataset.

Example usage:

```Shell
python surf.py /path/to/data/file
```
